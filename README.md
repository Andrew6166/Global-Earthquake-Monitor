# Global-Earthquake-Monitor
Simple Earthquake Monitor using WEBGLEarth, PHP, and Javascript
I created this because I was bored, and tell you the truth I hated using other peoples apps and websites if I could create my own.
So here is a working example http://earthquakeglobal.000webhostapp.com

I created it using a free API provided by USGS https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/
Its not a complete app, and its a bit messy. But thats cause I created in a day, and decided after all this time to share it to anyone who wants to learn.

You dont need to setup anything, no api keys needed. Just have PHP installed and your gooood
Please however dont claim this as yours (thats selfish)

If you have any questions Ill be happy to respond.
