# Global-Earthquake-Monitor
Simple Earthquake Monitor using WEBGLEarth, PHP, and Javascript
I created this because I was bored, and tell you the truth I hated using other peoples apps and websites if I could create my own.
So here is a working example http://earthquakeglobal.000webhostapp.com

Have fun!
